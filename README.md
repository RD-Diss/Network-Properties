# Network-Properties

This project contains code and data for my dissertation project. Its aim is analysing network properties of pollinator and parasite networks along with environmental variables associated with the networks.


All_Parasite_Data/All_Pollinator_Data.csv - Contains the outputs of the network analysis for the pollinator and parasite networks.

Polreferences/Parreferences - Contains the references and some metadata about the corresponding networks. 

Pollinators.zip- Contains the data for each of the pollinator networks as well as a reference file detailing the sources of each of the networks. 

Parasite.zip- Contains the data for each of the parasite networks as well as a reference file detailing the sources of each of the networks.

network_properties.r - Contains the code that analyses the properties of the networks along with the method for extracting Worldclim data according to their geographical location.
